 <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
<section id="neuropose" class="neuropose">
<h3>NeuroPose</h3>
<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Python, TensorFlow, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML</span></strong>
<p>NeuroPose is a comprehensive research model that studies how patients recover from neurological ailments with the hopes of gaining insights into the recovery process and treatment effectivity. NeuroPose combines pose estimation in three dimensions with innovative post-processing techniques. NeuroPose can be hosted as a server or instantiated locally. The pose estimator is written in Python with TensorFlow, while post-processing uses a combination of Python and MATLAB, and the default server environment uses some basic HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>My work on NeuroPose has been sponsored by Brown University's UTRA program and performed in collaboration with the lab of Dr. Liqi Shu. I would like to thank Dr. Shu and the other members of the lab for their support and assistance in bringing this meaningful project to life.</p>
</section>
<section id="tcp" class="tcp">
<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Go</span></strong></p>
<p>My implementation of TCP/IP closely follows the latest RFC specification and is completed in Go. It handles everything from simulating routers with the RIP protocol to allowing interfaces to send and receive anything from individual packets to fully-fledged files. It additionally implements TCP retransmissions and Zero-Window Probing, and will be expanded to include congestion control in the near future.</p>
</section>
<section id="boot" class="boot">
<h3>LevOS BootLoader</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">x86 Assembly<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>The LevOS BootLoader is a two-stage bootloader written entirely in x86 assembly. It loads relevant sectors into the memory, integrates with BIOS functions to check hardware specifications, and initializes the system to the point that a kernel can safely be loaded. This bootloader prioritizes minimalism and efficiency and is intended to be used with the future LevOS (see below).</p>
</section>
<section id="aim" class="aim">
<h3><a href="https://github.com/levineuwirth/riskofaim">Risk of Aim</a></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">C#, GLSL<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>Risk of Aim is an aim-training video game that incorporates roguelike elements to ensure a fun but competitive experience. The game incorporates 3D graphics and complex mechanics systems to track player health, accuracy, and activated abilities.</p>
</section>
<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<section id="weenix" class="weenix">
<h3>Weenix</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">C, x86 Assembly<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>Weenix is the culmination of Brown's infamous CS169 Operating Systems Lab. I will be completing this kernel over the Spring 2025 semester. It will include virtual memory, paging, and a basic shell.</p>
</section>
<section id="strat" class="strat">
<h3>Stratagem</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rust<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>Stratagem is an upcoming grand-strategy video game inspired by those of Paradox Interactive that I have been sporadically developing for nearly two years.</p>
</section>
  <h2>Future Projects</h2>
  <section id="levos" class="levos">
<h3>LevOS</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">x86 Assembly, C, Rust, Go<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>My plan for my capstone requirement at Brown University is to combine many elements of computer systems that I have implemented in different places into one enormous project. This will involve the creation of a largely working operating system. The bootloader is already implemented. Over the summer of 2025 and into the fall semester I will be adapting Weenix into a customized kernel that incorporates my own previous implementation of system calls for I/O, process management, and a customized threads library. Once this is done, I will attempt to port my TCP/IP implementation to LevOS, resulting in a full system of my own design.</p>
