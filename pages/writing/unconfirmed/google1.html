  <h3>AI Principles</h3>
  <p>Google has long sparked controversy with their policies. The typical evolution of a Google policy is as follows: first, the policy is introduced and casts the corporation as a beacon of light, an angel among the darkness of big technology. Then, Google starts covertly acting against their own policy, sometimes causing huge lawsuits and investigations mostly at the hand of the European Union, and sometimes not. Eventually, the executives decide that enough is enough and they blatantly change the policies to remove whatever principles remain in them - deciding not to hide their evil actions any further in their policies (though they do continue to hide them based on the statements that they'll make at the time!).</p>
  <p>This week, Google added another principle to the graveyard of idealism by removing a pledge not to use AI for weapons or surveillance. To me, this is mainly concerning due to the weapons part - we already knew from Google's privacy policy that they would use content gathered from their services in the training of large language models, so surveillance in the name of AI was already occurring. (This would shock no one who knows about Google's practices and true business model, and hint: it is not being a quality search engine!). The use of artificial intelligence in weapons and warfare, especially that of models which do not originate in academia nor provide a publication nor source code for viewing, is an ethical fault of utmost severity.</p>
<h4>Chasing profits to the point of selective nihilism</h4>
<p> If we take a step back and examine the market trends, the reasoning for this move from Google is clear. It further demonstrates the emphasis on profit above all else that has defined this company for essentially my entire lifetime.
